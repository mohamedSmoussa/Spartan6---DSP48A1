 ⚙️ Spartan-6 DSP48A1 Verilog Project

This is a Verilog-based hardware design project targeting the **Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA** family. The design showcases the use of the **DSP48A1** slice for implementing high-performance arithmetic operations like multiplication, addition, and MAC (Multiply-Accumulate). The project is modular, reusable, and suitable for signal processing applications or custom accelerators.


## 🚀 Features

- 🔧 Utilizes **DSP48A1** primitive on Spartan-6
- ♻️ Modular Verilog design (easy to integrate or extend)
- 🧠 Supports multiply, add, and accumulate modes
- 🔀 Includes register-mux structures and 4-to-1 MUX
- 🧪 Testbench support for simulation and verification
- ⚡ Optimized for pipelined high-speed operation


## 💡 Design Rationale

This design focuses on:
1. ✅ Ensuring stable, synchronized inputs using registered staging.
2. 🔀 Offering flexible input selection using a 4-to-1 MUX (`MUX4_1`) after registration.
3. 🔩 Feeding controlled and clean data into the **DSP48A1** slice for fast arithmetic.
